      <h3> How To Play: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There are two players, Player One and Player Two.</li>
        <li>The board has a total of 30 questions across 6 categories. The more difficult a question is, the more it is worth.</li>
        <li>To start, pick which player will go first. The starting player picks the first card by clicking on it to reveal the question.</li>
        <li>Once the question is revealed, players have 6 seconds to read the card and buzz in if they would like to answer. (To 'buzz', Player One presses the A key and Player Two presses the L key.)</li>
        <li>After 6 seconds, whichever player buzzed first will have the opportunity to type his or her answer.</li>
          <ul>
            <li> If they get the answer right, they gain the points; otherwise, they lose those points.</li>
            <li>If no one buzzes within those 6 seconds, neither player will have the opportunity to answer the question.</li>
            <li>When typing answers, players do not need to include "the" or "a". And there's no need to type answers in the form of a question.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If the player answers correctly, he/she chooses the next card. Otherwise the player who got the most recent correct answer chooses the next card.</li>
        <li>The game ends when all 30 questions have been clicked. The player with the highest score wins.</li>
        <li>Pressing the Start Game button at any point during the game will reset all questions and player scores.</li>
    </ul>
